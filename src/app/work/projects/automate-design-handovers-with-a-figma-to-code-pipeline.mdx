## Overview

Development of a modern and innovative system for SecuriSense using Geo-fencing, Indoor Positioning Systems (IPS), and computer vision, enabling organizations to automate attendance tracking, resource monitoring, and enhance security across various sectors including factories, educational institutions, and healthcare facilities.

## Key Features

- **User Management**: Implemented secure login, registration, and profile management with multi-factor authentication and role-based permissions, ensuring only authorized personnel can access sensitive areas and data.
- **Automated Attendance**: Built a comprehensive attendance system that integrates with geo-fencing, IPS, and facial recognition to eliminate manual errors and ensure accurate record-keeping.
- **Physical Access Control**: Created a sophisticated system for defining restricted zones and monitoring resource movement, significantly enhancing security and preventing unauthorized access.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Developed configurable notification systems for attendance compliance, access control violations, and other critical events requiring immediate attention.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Designed real-time monitoring dashboards with tabular and graphical reports, providing organizations with actionable insights for informed decision-making.

## Technologies Used

- **Java Spring Boot**: For robust backend API development and business logic implementation.
- **Next.js**: For creating a responsive and interactive web interface.
- **Firebase & PostgreSQL**: For real-time data synchronization and secure, scalable database management.
- **Android Development**: Using Android Studio for native mobile applications with GPS and gyroscope integration.
- **Computer Vision**: Implementing facial recognition and object detection for enhanced security measures.
- **WebSockets**: For real-time communication between clients and server.
- **Tracking Technologies**: Utilizing GPS, Wi-Fi triangulation, BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy), and gyroscope for comprehensive indoor/outdoor positioning.
- **Docker**: For platform containerization ensuring consistent deployment across environments.

## Challenges and Learnings

A significant challenge was integrating multiple tracking technologies (GPS, IPS, and computer vision) while ensuring system reliability and accuracy. We implemented customizable alerts and role-based permissions to balance comprehensive security with user convenience. The real-time monitoring system required careful optimization to handle data from numerous sources simultaneously without compromising performance across diverse organizational environments.

## Outcome

SecuriSense effectively addresses the challenges of resource management and security through automation, significantly reducing human error in attendance tracking and access control. The system's real-time insights and detailed dashboards empower organizations to make informed decisions, while its scalability ensures adaptability to evolving needs. With its comprehensive approach to operational efficiency and security, SecuriSense represents a valuable solution for modern enterprises across various sectors.
